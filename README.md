## Built With
- [Next 13 App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs#app-router-vs-pages-router)
- [Next Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [Neon](https://neon.tech/)
- [Fireship](https://fireship.io/courses/nextjs/)

## TODO
I built this in a weekend with the Fireship tutorial to learn App Router. If I had more time I'd probably want to:
- [ ] Accept & Display User Content
- [ ] Add additional auth providers
- [ ] Use [Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations)
- [ ] Improve TS types (no any)
- [ ] Improve Styles (Tailwind?)
- [ ] Validate form inputs (RHF/Zod?)
- [ ] Consistent error/loading state handling throughout
